Overview
---------

I am now a Postdoc researcher in Prof. `Tiwary's group <https://sites.google.com/site/pratyushtiwary/home?authuser=0>`_.

I have got my Ph.D. degree at Temple University in USA. My supervisors are Dr. `Eric Borguet <https://sites.temple.edu/borguet/>`_ and Dr. `Vincenzo Carnevale <https://carnevalelab.org/>`_. I study water in various enviroments, especially water/alumina interfaces, using molecular dynamics simulations.  Below are projects I have investigated in recent years:

- Ion adsorptions at water/alumina interfaces.

- Free energy calculation of proton transfer in bulk water.

Currently, I am investigating these interesting questions:

- The pattern of amino acid adsorption.

- The topology of hydrogen bonds of interfacial water.

Besides physical chemistry, I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, especially, how these tools and proper physics models are used in big data and business analysis. 

Before moving to Temple University, I investigated the design and sythesis of molecular imprinted polymers to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate pestides with my supervisor Prof. `Tianying Guo <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianying-Guo>`_.
