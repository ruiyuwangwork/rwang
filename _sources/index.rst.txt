Overview
---------

I am now a Postdoc researcher in Prof. `Tiwary's group <https://sites.google.com/site/pratyushtiwary/home?authuser=0>`_. I am current investigating nucleation and phase transition of aqueous solutions under certain enviroments with potential applications on energy science using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning.

I have got my Ph.D. degree at Temple University in USA, supervised by Dr. `Eric Borguet <https://sites.temple.edu/borguet/>`_ and Dr. `Vincenzo Carnevale <https://carnevalelab.org/>`_. During that time, I study the interaction between ions and water at water/solid interfaces. Please do not hesitate to visit the `research <https://ruiyuwangwork.github.io/rwang/research.html>`_ page for more details.

Besides physical chemistry, I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, especially, how these tools and proper physics models are used in big data and business analysis. 

Before moving to Temple University, I investigated the design and sythesis of molecular imprinted polymers to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate pestides with my supervisor Prof. `Tianying Guo <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianying-Guo>`_.
