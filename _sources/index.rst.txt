Overview
---------

I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in `Tiwary's group <https://sites.google.com/site/pratyushtiwary/home?authuser=0>`_. I am investigating the nucleation and phase transition of aqueous solutions under specific environments with potential applications in energy science, using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning.


I earned my Ph.D. degree at Temple University in the USA, under the supervision of Prof. `Eric Borguet <https://sites.temple.edu/borguet/>`_ and Prof. `Vincenzo Carnevale <https://carnevalelab.org/>`_. During that time, I studied the interaction between ions and water at water/solid interfaces. Feel free to visit the `research <https://ruiyuwangwork.github.io/rwang/research.html>`_ page for more details.


In addition to physical chemistry, I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, especially how these tools, along with proper physics models, are used in big data and business analysis.


Before joining Temple University, I investigated the design and synthesis of molecular imprinted polymers to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate pesticides with my supervisor, Prof. `Tianying Guo <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianying-Guo>`_.
