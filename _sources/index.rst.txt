Overview
---------

I am now a PhD student in Temple University. My supervisors are Dr. `Eric Borguet <https://sites.temple.edu/borguet/>`_ and Dr. `Vincenzo Carnevale <https://carnevalelab.org/>`_. I am doing various types of research projects and they are all about water. I am focusing on water structures in several enviroments, such as chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, ion adsorption at water/alumina interfaces using both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, especially free energy calculations using enhanced sampling techniques.  

Currently, I am carrying out pKa calculations, investigating surface-solute interactions and proton/hydroxide ion behavior. Besides physical chemistry, I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, especially, how these tools and proper physics models are used in big data and business analysis.
